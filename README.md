# Minimalistic Go package for sending Slack messages

All you can do with this package is to send a simple message to a channel of your choice, under a given user and with custome icon (provided by URL).  
An example follows:

```
import "slackman"

func main(){
    msg := NewMessage("my-secret", "my-channel", "user", "message", "https://awesome-icon.jpg")
    msg.Send()
}
```
